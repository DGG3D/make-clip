# make-clip
Turns a series of turntable images into a little .mov clip

Example: 
```
python make-clip.py my-directory
```
where `my-directory` contains PNG images of the frames that are named by increasing numbers with matching padding (e.g., 128 images numbered "000.png", "001.png", ..., "127.png")
